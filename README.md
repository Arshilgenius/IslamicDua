Assalamu ªalaikum to all Muslims and greetings to everyone else,

This repository is about an Android app which would include all the dua from Hisnul Muslim. The aim of this app is to create the
best Hisnul Muslim app the Play Store has ever seen, in terms of usability and performance.

# Requirements
1. No Ads. The app should be given to the people free of charge with all features accessible.
2. Must adhere to Google design guidelines in terms of icon design, font use, and to a large extent even app patterns.
3. The Arabic text should be clear with the correct tashkeel/harakaat.
4. The app should have no linguistic mistakes with regard to grammar and syntax for the interface as well as duas.
I'm getting tired of poorly written apps.

# Constraints
1. App will support platforms 4.1.2 (JellyBean) and upwards. This may change later.

# (Intended) Features
1. All duas from Hisnul Muslim. I also hope to add verification for the sources in the future. The app should not have duas which
are not present in Hisnul Muslim. This is after all a Hisnul Muslim app.
2. Bookmarking function. Users should be allowed to bookmark a certain dua so that they can easily access it later on. Each
separate dua should have this feature. So, if there are 2 duas for "waking up", then each of them would have the ability to be
bookmarked.
3. Users should be able to "share" the dua on social networks (or other apps as well).
4. The app should be optimized for performance.
