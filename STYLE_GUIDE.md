Dua Content Style Guide
=======================
This document explains the style that should be followed when entering dua into the database or when reporting errors or mistakes in the contents. The app supports the original Arabic along with its translation and reference. Transliteration has been deliberately left out due to the different types available and also the requirement of providing different transliteration tables for each language since latin pronunciation changes between languages as well. Users are better off learning how to read Arabic as opposed to getting used to transliteration.

# Arabic
1. Convey meaning in and of itself. If a literate Arab was to read the text and understand what section he's in, he would immediately understand what the text is for.
2. It should have complete *tashkeel*/*harakaat*. Dua which are lacking in this are to be reported. The aim is for complete and correct diacritics for the Arabic text. Neither completeness or correctness should be compromised.
3. Any numberals that appear in the text must be Eastern.

# English
To Complete.

# Reference
1. At this point in time, only the reference should be provided and nothing else. There should be no attempts at providing authentication information (*takreej*). This is because different scholars have different methodogies for authentication and this then results in an app which has an amalgam of different authentication rulings for different dua. This information may be added later if a consistent method is found.

2. All references must point to the Arabic versions of the books. This has a couple of benefits. 
  1. The original Arabic books of Hadith are more readily available.
  2. The original (book) Hisnul Muslim uses the Arabic versions as well and therefore saves a lot of effort *translating* them into the reference numbers found in the English editions due to summarizing and removal of ahadith with differing chains of narration.

3. Names of Imams, Muhadditheen and 'Ulama should be consistent (in spelling) throughout and follow conventional English transliteration. A table will be added later on, Insha'Allah.

4. Most of the referenced works are volumous and therefore the reference should be as follows:

```[Scholar/Book/Work] [Volume Number]/[Hadith Number]```
